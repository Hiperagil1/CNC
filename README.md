# CNC
Introducing a DIY CNC (Computer Numerical Control) project featuring two stepper motors salvaged from DVD-ROM drives, a servo motor, and a pen for precision drawing.

This CNC setup utilizes repurposed stepper motors from DVD-ROM drives to control the X and Y axes, providing accurate and controlled movement. Stepper motors are known for their precise positioning, making them ideal for CNC applications. The inclusion of a servo motor enhances functionality, allowing for additional degrees of freedom and potentially enabling more complex movements or tool manipulation.

The pen, coupled with the servo motor, serves as the tool for drawing. This CNC system is designed for precision tasks like plotting or drawing intricate patterns on various surfaces. The servo motor adds an extra layer of control, enabling the pen to be lifted or adjusted as needed during the drawing process.
